Week 5 — Model Training, Real-Time Integration & Evaluation

Goals:
- Train all models fully
- Integrate model with real-time webcam feed
- Run experiments + collect metrics
- Optimize performance
- Prepare visual results (graphs, tables, confusion matrix)

Tasks Completed:

1. Final Model Training
- Trained CNN model on LeapGestRecog dataset.
- Multiple training runs with hyperparameter adjustments.
- Applied dropout and batch normalization.
- Achieved stable accuracy on validation set.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Compared optimizers: Adam, RMSProp, SGD.
- Tuned architecture: kernel sizes, number of layers, dense layers.
- Used callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint.

3. Experiments & Evaluation
- Generated accuracy/loss curves.
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Documented training configurations and results.

4. Real-Time Gesture Recognition
- Integrated model with OpenCV.
- Implemented webcam frame capture + preprocessing pipeline.
- Real-time predictions displayed on screen.

5. Performance Testing
- Tested under multiple lighting conditions and hand angles.
- Evaluated robustness across different users.
- Noted limitations for future improvements.

6. Results Documentation
- Saved graphs, tables, and architecture diagram.
- Prepared content for final report.

Summary:
Week 5 resulted in a fully functional real-time hand gesture recognition system with complete experimental validation and documentation.
